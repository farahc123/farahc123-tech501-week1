# Headings:
## Sub-heading
### Small sub-heading
#### Smaller sub-heading
##### Even smaller sub-heading
###### Smallest sub-heading possible

--- 

# Bullet points and line breaks

- Use when sequence is **not** important
* Add a bullet point using asterisk
- Or add a bullet point using hyphen
  - Add an indented point with the tab key
- Escape back to non-indented bullet point using backspace; escape out of bullet points entirely with backspace

## Numbered steps 

1. Use when sequence is important
2. Manually type number for step 1
3. Hitting enter automatically continues the numbers
   1. On new line, hit tab to indent
   * On a new line, use backspace to escape numbered list and enter sub-point with asterisk or hyphen

<br> Use HTML 
<br>to insert breaks
<br> by wrapping text in \<br>

# Bold, italics, and formatting

- Apply **bold** with Ctrl+b
- Apply *italics* with Ctrl+i
- ***Apply both using both commands***
- strikthrough text with double tildes on each side, e.g. ~~done~~
- note that you can't underline in markdown

> use ">" as first character on a line for a blockquote

# Images

- Drag and drop while holding shift on an image to automatically embed it in a file (best practice is to put these in an images folder in the repo)
- Add alt text in square brackets

![chocolate](../images/chocolate.jpg)

# Links

- Use square brackets [] for the link text and curly brackets () immediately afterwards for the link itself
- e.g. click [here](http://www.google.com) to go to Google
- To link to a file, **hold Shift** while dragging it into VS Code

# VSCode notes

-   Make sure to turn autosave on from VS Code File menu
-   First file in a repo should be README.md
-   Use **ctrl-shift-p** to bring up command line in VS code and search for something, e.g. "create table of contents"

# Helpful tools

- [**Clipboard to Markdown**](https://euangoddard.github.io/clipboard2markdown/) â€” allows you to retain the formatting of pre-formatted text and convert it into markdown
