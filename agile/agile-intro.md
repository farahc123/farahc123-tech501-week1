### History 
- Software crisis in 1970–90s — software was not being delivered (or not on time), over budget, unreliable, & hard to maintain
- This led to development of Waterfall, as people came up with simpler, slimmer, less prescriptive methods for software development

### Agile 
- Came out of Waterfall
- Philosophy:
  - Has lots of methodologies, e.g. TDD, FDD, Lean, Kanban, Scrum
  - Naturally doesn't involve a deadline, but it can work to them via **forecasting** — reducing scope (i.e. supplementary features/non-critical functionality) to suit a date
  - **Individuals & interactions **more important than processes and tools when it comes down to it
  - Getting **working software** more important than comprehensive/immediate documentation
  - **Customer collaboration** more important than contract negotiation
  - **Responding/adapting to chang**e more important than following a plan and being prescriptive
  - Has 12 principles — most relevant to devops are continuous delivery, delivering working software frequently to end users, and reflecting at regular intervals
  - Involves people with business, dev, ops, engineering expertise working together to create a product
  - Should help focus and productivity
  - If Agile teams are used by an org, it's likely DevOps engineers will be on a "development team"
- Agile might not always be best for a company depending on their existing culture and how willing they are to adapt to it
- As teams become more Agile, DevOps is more needed
- Stages of Agile fluency model:
  - **Focusing**: shifting team culture
  - **Delivering**: shifting team skills; this is where DevOps becomes essential
  - **Optimising**: shifting organisational structure
  - **Strengthening**: shifting organisational culture
- Not all orgs that say they're Agile are they may be a **cargo cult**:
  - When something looks like Agile because an org has adopted some outward signs
  - But it isn't because they aren't really people-centric and ignoring elements (e.g. adaptive planning or planning being less important) that are uncomfortable to their current culture

### Scrum
  - Involves daily **stand-ups**: quite short meetings with standard questions e.g. about what you did yday, what you'll do today, & any blockers
  - Involves **sprints** — pull in tasks from backlog (known as **user stories**) to complete; standard length of **2 weeks**; team then **reviews** what they actually achieved and what needs to go back into backlog; and conducts a retrospective (**retro**) of what went well and what needs to be improved
  - Tasks are prioritised by what will add most business value
  - Good for projects that will likely feature trial and error, where things are changing rapidly
  - Even though software still gets over budget and late, Agile helps the software crisis because it shows progress with working software and is therefore more likely to meet requirements
