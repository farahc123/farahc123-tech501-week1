- when deleting, delete everything associated with vm's name (e.g. if vm ends with week1-vm, everything week1-vm's name is associated with it), so vm, ip, network security group, network interface, disk
- BE SURE NOT TO DELETE RESOURCE GROUP
- go into three-dot menu, apply force delete, confirm deletion with typing
